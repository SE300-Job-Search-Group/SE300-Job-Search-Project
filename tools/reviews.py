If you talk to the right people you can move anywhere in the company, youll work more hours but dont expect high raises. They offer unlimited overtime instead of higher pay. Pay was mid. Benefits were good, they give you SpaceX stock for staying in the company and you get to buy SpaceX stock with your paycheck as well. Also they have free coffee and baristas everywhere and $5 meals from constantly rotating food trucks. But honestly I felt like a part of my soul died everyday spent there. Also theres a lot of people who work here who see Elon musk as some kind of god. Its kinda weird. Felt very cult like. I left with like 100 shares of SpaceX stock that are mine forever. I work here because like most I was a fan of the company and what its trying to accomplish, it is really amazing to directly see the results of your work. Its easy to get overwhelmed when you first start, sort of star struck if you will. So your willing to do everything they ask of you and then some to help accomplish the mission and do something great. After that wears off however you realize that the company doesn't stop asking more and more from you, everything you have to give in fact. Yes they do pay you well provided you put in the time and show your commitment but at a certain point you have to ask yourself if its worth it, especially if you have a family. Because you won't get to see much of them, a 10 hour work day is the minimum and you will regularly be asked to do 12 hour days and weekends for months at a time. If you are single and don't have many life commitments I definitely recommend this job for you."]

Defense contracting takes some getting used to if you're from the private sector. Little incentive for efficiency. Lots of very rigid, defined processes. Can feel like it's impossible to get things done. LOTS of turnover means there's opportunity for advancement, and also stress and inefficiency. Very conformist environment. Great parental leave policy, but 60 hr weeks don't allow much time with the baby after that. Very cliquey. Lots of turnover happens. Satisfaction depends on what group you are in.

If you're young and looking for adventure, or if you have some deep need to self-actualize and your true passion is not necessarily technical research, this may not be the best long-term choice (though the fantastic schedule also means you'll have time for personal development). However, if you're looking for a good, stable job with interesting work, or if you're deeply passionate about a specific research area, this will be a fantastic job for you. The overall experience at the company has been satisfactory, but there are areas for improvement.
